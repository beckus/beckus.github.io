		    <!-- The circuit icon is the icon for the PCB application in the gEDA suite
		         (named application-x-pcb-layout-48.png and obtained from the data folder in the source repository).
                 It was created by Tomaz Solc and Peter Clifton and is licensed
                 under the GPL2 license.  I cropped and rotated the original icon for a better fit.
